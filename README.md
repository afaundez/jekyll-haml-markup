# Jekyll Haml Markup

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) plugin that enables [Haml](http://haml.info) as a markup option for layouts, partials, and pages.

## Installation

Add to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'jekyll-haml-markup', group: :jekyll_plugins
```

## Usage

Name your layouts, partials, and pages with the `.haml` extension. This plugin intercepts the default `include` and compile your Haml template to HTML.

## Development
This gem uses a hook for Haml layouts compiling, modifies the `include` tag, and add a Haml converter.

There are lots of border cases that have to be tested before production use.

I started this gem because I couldn't make work the [jekyll-haml](https://github.com/samvincent/jekyll-haml) gem, which seems inactive.
